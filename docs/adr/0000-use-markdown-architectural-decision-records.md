# Use Markdown Architectural Decision Records

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to record architectural decisions made in this project.
Which format and structure should these records follow?

## Considered Options

* [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) 2.1.2 – The Markdown Architectural Decision Records
* Formless – No conventions for file format and structure

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "MADR 2.1.2", because

* We need to start somewhere, and it's better to have some format than no format.
* MADR seems to be good enough for our current needs.
