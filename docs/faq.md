## Why can't I `kubectl run`?

To increase security, Compliance Kubernetes does not allow by default to run containers as root.
Additionally, the container image is not allowed to be pulled from a public docker hub registry and all Pods are required to be selected by some NetworkPolicy.
This ensures that an active decision has been made for what network access the Pod should have and helps avoid running "obscure things found on the internet".

Considering the above, you should start by pushing the container image you want to use to Harbor and [make sure it doesn't run as root][docker-user].
See [this document][harbor-oidc-docker] for how to use OIDC with docker.
With that in place, you will need to create a NetworkPolicy for the Pod you want to run.
Here is an example of how to create a NetworkPolicy that allows all TCP traffic (in and out) for Pods with the label `run: blah`.

!!!note
    This is just an example, not a good idea!
    You should limit the policy to whatever your application really needs.

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: blah
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      run: blah
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  ingress:
  # Allow all incoming traffic
  - {}
  egress:
  # Allow all outgoing traffic
  - {}
EOF
```

Now you are ready to run a Pod!
Make sure you match the name with the label you used for the NetworkPolicy.
Kubectl will automatically set the label `run: <name-of-pod>` when you create a Pod with `kubectl run <name-of-pod>`.
Here is an example command (please replace the `$MY_HARBOR_IMAGE`):

```bash
kubectl run blah --rm -ti --image=$MY_HARBOR_IMAGE
```

If your image runs as root by defaults, but can handle running as another user, you may override the user by adding a flag like this to the above command:

```
--overrides='{ "spec": { "securityContext": "runAsUser": 1000, "runAsGroup": 1000 } }'
```
