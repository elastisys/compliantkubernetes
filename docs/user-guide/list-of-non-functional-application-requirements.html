    Application components MUST be loosely coupled. Data sharing MUST happen exclusively via versioned APIs.
    <details>
        <summary>Why is this important?</summary>
        This allows the application team to scale. Each application developer only needs to work within a bounded context, reducing cognitive load.
    </details>

<tr>
<td>R1.2</td>
<td>
    The application MUST use separate containers for synchronous API requests and running asynchronous batch jobs.
    <details>
        <summary>Why is this important?</summary>
        This allows the application to make better use of resources and better tolerate failures. Being more exposed, synchronous code needs to be better tested and more secure than it's asynchronous counterpart. Furthermore, the asynchronous code may be managed by a queue to better handle spikes in work. The synchronous code can then focus on quick response times and good interaction with the user, without having to block for things such as sending a confirmation email.

    The application SHOULD crash if a fatal condition is encountered, such as bad configuration or inability to connect to a downstream service.
    <details>
        <summary>Why is this important?</summary>
        This allows Kubernetes to stop a rolling update before end-user traffic is impacted.

    The application SHOULD accept inbound requests using the RESTful API.
    <details>
        <summary>Why is this important?</summary>
        This allows the application to take advantage of the Ingress Controller for improved security via HTTPS, HSTS, IP allowlisting, rate-limiting, etc.

</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>

<tr>
<td>R2.2</td>
<td>
    All application APIs, internally and externally facing, synchronous (i.e. REST) and asynchronous (i.e. messages) MUST be versioned, and components MUST be able to process old API calls for as long as there are producers of these calls in production.
    <details>
        <summary>Why is this important?</summary>
        This allows each application component to be release independently with zero downtime via a rolling update strategy.
    </details>
</td>

<tr>
<td>R2.3</td>
<td>
    The application MUST validate all incoming API requests as well as responses to outgoing API requests.

        This is good security hygiene.
    </details>
</td>

<tr>
<td>R2.4</td>
<td>
    If the application has asynchronous parts, then the application MUST use the message queue provided by the platform for communicating between its synchronous and asynchronous parts.
    <details>
        <summary>Why is this important?</summary>
        The platform team will have put a lot of effort into making sure that the message queue is fault-tolerant. The application team can build upon this to improve application fault-tolerance, as opposed to reinventing the wheel.
    </details>
</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>R2.5</td>
<td>
    The asynchronous components in the application that consume messages MUST be compatible with old message formats until no producers of the old message format remain deployed.
    <details>
        <summary>Why is this important?</summary>
        This allows the application to employ rolling update between components which communicate via the message queue.
    </details>
</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>R2.6</td>
<td>
    The application MUST set reasonable TTL for all messages sent via the platform-provide message queue.
    <details>
        <summary>Why is this important?</summary>
        This ensures that messages don't accumulate in the message queue in case of application bugs, potentially leading to capacity issues. In best case, such capacity issues lead to unnecessary costs. In worst case, such capacity issues can lead to new messages not being accepted and application malfunctioning.
    </details>

<tr>
<td>R2.7</td>

    The application MUST gracefully handle connection resets (e.g., due to fail-over) of downstream components.
    <details>
        <summary>Why is this important?</summary>
        Sometimes the platform team needs to migrate Pods from one Node to another, e.g., for maintenance. The application component consuming a Pod which moved needs to tolerate this.

        The platform team will have invested a lot of effort in making the key-value store fault-tolerant. By moving session state into the key-value store, each application replica is equal. No sticky load-balancing is needed and rolling updates are possible without disturbing the end-user.
