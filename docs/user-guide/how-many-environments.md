!!! elastisys "For Elastisys Managed Services Customers"

    You can order a new Environment by filing a [service ticket](https://elastisys.atlassian.net/servicedesk/).

    If you have multiple Environments, and one or more have been clearly designated to be non-production Environments, Elastisys will apply major and minor updates to your non-production Environment(s) at least five working days before applying said update to your production Environment(s).

    For more information, please read [ToS 3.5 Updates and Upgrades](https://elastisys.com/legal/terms-of-service/#35-updates-and-upgrades).

Compliant Kubernetes recommends setting up at least two separate environments: one for testing and one for production.

# How Many Environments?

## Definitions

For the purpose of this document we use the following distinction:

**Application Deployment** - One instance of a customer's application. Commonly, multiple application deployments are used in the software development life cycles, such as: local, development, integration, testing, staging, and production.

**Environment** - One instance of a Compliant Kubernetes deployment. One Environment is composed of two Kubernetes Clusters, the Management Cluster and Workload Cluster.

## Levels of Isolation

Various levels of isolation between Application Deployments can be achieved while using Kubernetes:

- Same Namespace, "separated" only by Helm Release
- Same Cluster, separate Namespaces
- Same Environment, separate Workload Clusters
- Different Environments

## Relevant Regulations

Many regulations require strict separation between testing and production Application Deployments.
In particular, production data should not be compromised, no matter what happens in testing Application Deployments.

Similarly, some regulations -- such as Medical Devices Regulation (MDR) -- require you to take a risk-based approach to changing the tech stack. Depending on your risk assessment, this implies verifying changes in a non-production Application Deployment before going into production.

## Recommendations

Taking into account the relevant regulations, Compliant Kubernetes recommends setting up **at least two Environments**:

- non-production Environment hosting Application Deployments from development up to staging;
- production Environment hosting the production Application Deployment.

However, the exact number of Application Deployments and Environments will depend on your needs.
Please use the two figures below to reason about environments, trading developer productivity and data security:
