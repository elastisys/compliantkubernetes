# NIST SP 800-171 Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Systems and Organizations

!!!important

    A software product -- such as Compliant Kubernetes -- cannot by itself be NIST SP 800-171 conform or certified.
    Instead, NIST SP 800-171 sets requirements **on the organization** and how it works with the software.
    Compliant Kubernetes can support fulfilling all NIST SP 800-171 requirements, provided that the organization has suitable policies and processes in place.
    For example, a tight integration needs to exist between onboard and offboarding personnel in HR and the Identity Provider which integrates with Compliant Kubernetes.
    Below we map NIST SP 800-171 requirements to Compliant Kubernetes features.

    This document was written based on NIST SP 800-171 **Rev. 2**.
    As of Jan 2024, Rev. 3 was in final public draft stage.

## Notes on Some Requirements

### 3.3.4

Compliant Kubernetes alerts, e.g., if Fluentd is unable to deliver audit logs to OpenSearch.

### 3.3.8 and 3.3.9

Audit logs are stored in OpenSearch and are write-only.

### 3.4.1, 3.4.2 and 3.4.3

Compliant Kubernetes configuration is fully stored in Git and can benefits from Git merge requests, reviews, etc.

### 3.13.5

All Compliant Kubernetes environments should run inside the organization's demilitarized zone (DMZ).

### 3.13.15

Compliant Kubernetes uses HTTPS for all its Service endpoints.

### 3.13.16

Compliant Kubernetes recommends full-disk encryption at the infrastructure level.

### 3.14.1
