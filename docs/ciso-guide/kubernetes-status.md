The Compliant Kubernetes Status Dashboard shows a quick overview of the status of your kubernetes cluster.
This includes:

* Unhealthy pods
* Unhealthy nodes
* Resource requested of the total resources in the cluster
* Pods with missing resource requests

This makes it easy to identify when your cluster is not working correctly and helps you identify configuration that isn't following best practise.
