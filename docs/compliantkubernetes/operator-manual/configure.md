# Advanced Configuration

You have already been exposed to some of Compliant Kubernetes's configuration options while creating a cluster. If not, read that section first (e.g., [On Exoscale](/compliantkubernetes/operator-manual/exoscale/)).

This section will outline some advanced configuration topics.

## Overview

Compliant Kubernetes is composed of two layers, the Kubernetes layer and the apps layer. Each is configured slightly differently.

## Kubernetes Layer

To find all configuration option of the Kubernetes layer, please read the [upstream Kubespray](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray/blob/master/docs/vars.md) documentation.
Compliant Kubernetes overrides some of Kubespray's defaults, as shown [here](https://github.com/elastisys/compliantkubernetes-kubespray/tree/main/config).

## Apps Layer

The configuration of the apps layer is documented as comments in the `sc-config.yaml`, `wc-config.yaml` and `secrets.yaml` files generated by `./bin/ck8s init`. You can find the default [here](https://github.com/elastisys/compliantkubernetes-apps/tree/main/config/config).
If you find a configuration key is insufficiently documented, please [open a PR](https://github.com/elastisys/compliantkubernetes-apps/pulls).
